# APK Fix and Upgrade  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on resolving issues of an Android game application.  
The game challenges users to press directional arrows based on the result of the `modulo 4` operation applied to each digit of their ID number.

## Updates and Fixes I've done to keep the app from crashing
- Corrected an invalid URL in the application.  
- Resolved a problem with displaying **Toast** messages in the `Activity_Game`.  

---

## Game Instructions  
1. Each digit in the ID number is calculated using `modulo 4`.  
2. Press the corresponding arrow based on the result:  
   - **0**: Left arrow  
   - **1**: Right arrow  
   - **2**: Up arrow  
   - **3**: Down arrow  

3. After completing the game successfully, a **Toast** message will display the destination city's name.  
   - The city name is retrieved from a predefined list stored at a specific **URL**, using the 8th digit of the ID number as an index.
